1. Prepare your dataset in CSV format.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to preprocess your data and train the model.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Ensure the following before running the project:

1. All data should be numeric (no categorical variables).
2. Data should include a `DateTime` column and a target variable (e.g., VWAP).
3. No missing values in the dataset (impute if necessary).
4. Data must be in sequential order by date.
5. Analyze for trends, seasonality, cyclicity, and irregularities.
